== Cytoscape Graph Visualization - Lord of The Rings (LOTR)


The visualization code is in the lotrdemo folder that has been made to be standalone. 

So if you just click the html inside it should work even without a server.

You can even https://rawgit.com/neo4j-examples/cytoscape-graph-viz-lotr/master/lotrdemo/lotrdemo.html[run it here^], directly from GitHub.

Obviously a database will be needed (connection string (user: `neo4j`, password: `trinity`) hardcoded in `lotrdemo.js`).

For that there's an `import/lotr` folder with the csv files that have to be copied into your `NEO4J/import` directory.

The file `scripts/lotr.cypher` with statements to build the database.

You can run the script either from cypher-shell or from Neo4j browser with "multi-statement-editor" enabled in settings tab.

Note that you will also need https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[neo4j-graph-algorithms] installed  (single click in Neo4j-Desktop) as we're computing the betweenness and using that in the positioning of the nodes on screen.

Features :

- Finding path between two characters
- Character search boxes show possible hits if you start typing the name
- If you click the LOTR icon (upper left of the screen) you get the full map with the betweenness keeping the nodes apart, color coded by race of the character ...
